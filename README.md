# ðŸ¦– ZARK Gaming Community Cluster

Welcome to the **ZARK Gaming Community** repository!
This repo houses configuration files and settings for our **multi-game cluster**, so members can stay synced and admins can easily manage the servers.

## ðŸŽ® Games on the Cluster

* **Ark: Survival Evolved**
* **Ark: Survival Ascended**
* **Minecraft (Java Edition)**

Each game has its own directory in this repo containing relevant configs, tweaks, and server details.

## âš¡ Purpose

* Store server and cluster configuration files in one place
* Keep version control on all settings for easier rollbacks
* Allow admins (and brave contributors) to make updates without chaos
* Provide transparency to our community

## ðŸ¦• Final Notes

This repo is the brain of the ZARK cluster. Handle with care, respect the configs, and remember: **backups are your best friends**.

Happy surviving, mining, and dino-dodging!
