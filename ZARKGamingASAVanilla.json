Welcome to the ZARK Gaming Club, a family-friendly, dino-taming, base-building, poop-collecting paradise in the heart of South Africa!
    
We're absolutely raptor-ous to have you here. Our mission? Deliver the ultimate PvE experience without the griefers, chaos, or surprise T-Rex in your living room (unless you wanted one there).
To keep the island drama-free and the dinos happy, we've got a few house rules... nothing too wild, just enough to keep things civil while you ride your dino into the sunset.
Take a minute (yes, even you with the itchy 'punch everything' finger) to read rules 1 to 3 above. Still confused? Need a hug? Or just want to tattle on someone who named their dodo 'Thanos'? An Admin is just a Discord ticket away (coming soon).
    
Server stats you actually want to read (Yes, really!):
    
- Head on over to https://www.zarkgaming.co.za/ to see all our gaming servers
- EXPERIMENTAL : We've introduced an AI into our helpdesk, checkout #ai-helpdesk and remember - be gentle :D
- 3x Harvesting Rates : One swing and BOOM: you've got enough wood to build a small village (or an unnecessarily large toilet).
- 220 Max Wild Dino Limit : More dinos than you can poke with a tranq arrow. Tame wisely. Or don't. We like chaos.
- No Mods - just you and the wild!

And more goodies we're too lazy to list but you'll definitely thank us for later.
    
So get out there – tame it, build it, explore it... or get eaten trying."

                        "text": "- Be respectful: Any harassment, hate speech, toxic behavior or prejudiced comments of any kind, including sexism, racism, ageism, or homophobia / are not allowed.
- No griefing: This includes, but not limited to foundation spamming, blocking resources, or trolling players.
- No cheating: No exploiting glitches, bugs, or unintended mechanics.
- Keep it clean: Tribe, player, dino & Steam names must follow PEGI 12 / ESRB Teen standards. We recommend keeping your in-game and Discord name the same. No duplicate player names / first come, first serve.
- Keep it fair: Helping new players is welcome, but don’t spoil the game. No giving away high-level gear or dinos (e.g. Argy or higher). Giving OP dinos (250+ stats) may lead to a wipe or ban. Fair trades only.
- Keep it consistent: Keep tribe names the same across the cluster, this is to help you in the event of a character corruption or any restore functions.
- Build away from all key locations (e.g., obelisks, caves with artifacts, rare resource spawns and character spawns)
- One main base per tribe, plus one outpost (e.g., farming or taming base).
- No excessive land claiming, structures that go unused will be removed by Admins.
- Keep bases optimized, limit unnecessary spam structures to reduce lag.
- Do not build Vacuum Pods, they cause lag, map & character corruption (these will be removed by Admins without warning).
- Do not block or cage high-level wild creatures for extended periods.
- Keep breeding reasonable because it causes excessive dino hoarding and lag.
- Any unwanted dinos should be responsibly disposed of.
- Do not block or monopolize high-value resources (metal, crystal, oil, etc.).
- No killing passive creatures that belong to other players.
- Be mindful of community areas (such as teleporters, marketplaces, or public utilities).

- No AFK farming, excessive auto-clicking, or macro abuse.
